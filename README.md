How It Works
The extension uses a custom dictionary of pirate words and emojis to translate the content on any webpage. The translations happen right on the page, so it’s just like reading a pirate journal! 🏴

Example Dictionary
Here are some examples of translations:

hello → ahoy 
goodbye → fair winds 
friend → matey 
money → doubloons 
ship → pirate vessel 
treasure → booty 
king → captain 
queen → first mate 
sail → hoist the Jolly Roger 
sea → the briny deep 
Development
If you want to customize or extend the functionality, here’s how you can get started:

Add more pirate words: You can expand the dictionary in content.js to include more translations.
Change the emoji representations: Modify the emojis to make it more fun or themed to your liking.
Improve the translation: You could add a case-insensitive search or add more context to the translations if you want.
Modifying the Dictionary
You can add or modify the words and their pirate translations by editing the pirateDictionary in the content.js file:

js
Copy code
const pirateDictionary = {
  "hello": "ahoy ",
  "goodbye": "fair winds ",
  "friend": "matey ",
  "money": "doubloons ",
  "ship": "pirate vessel ",
  "treasure": "booty ",
  "king": "captain ",
  "queen": "first mate ",
  "sail": "hoist the Jolly Roger ",
  "sea": "the briny deep ",
  // Add more words to make up to 200
};
